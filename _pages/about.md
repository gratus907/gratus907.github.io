I am currently working as a Scientist at <a href="https://www.standigm.com">Standigm</a>, working on AI for drug discovery.

My research interests span methods for understanding and analyzing large-scale data, including machine learning, data mining and efficient algorithms. 
While I appreciate the rigor and beauty of theoretical approaches, I am also deeply passionate about applying these techniques to solve real-world problems.

Previously, I obtained my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Seoul National University (SNU), where I studied under the guidance of Prof. Kunsoo Park. My research during my Master’s program focused on efficient algorithms for large-scale graph data management and data mining, with a thesis centered on accurate and efficient estimation of subgraph counts.

Before that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences (double major) at SNU.
