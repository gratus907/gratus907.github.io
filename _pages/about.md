I am an undergraduate student at **Seoul National University**, majoring Computer Science and Mathematics. Also, I am a student researcher at **AIgenDrug Co. Ltd**. 

I am mainly interested in efficient algorithms on large graphs and graph data mining, as well as applying such techniques on other domains such as bio/chem-informatics.
