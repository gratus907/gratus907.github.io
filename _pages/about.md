I am currently in my final semester towards Master's in Computer Science at Seoul National University, under the guidance of Prof. Kunsoo Park.

I am broadly interested in methods for understanding and analyzing large-scale data, such as efficient algorithms, data mining and machine learning. 
While I love the rigor and beauty of theoretical methods, I am also deeply interested in practical applications of such techniques. 

Previously, I recieved Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematical Science (double major) also at SNU. I also have spent wonderful time at AIgenDrug Co. Ltd, studying data mining and machine learning on molecular graphs.
