### July 01, 2022
I attended top conference session at Korea Computer Congress. 

Researchers from POSTECH presented [Farthest-point Voronoi diagrams in the presence of rectangular obstacles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03198) which was published in SoCG 2022. Despite my relatively poor background knowledge on computational geometry, underlying ideas using monotone-path observations and plane-sweeping algorithm was indeed interesting.


### July 02, 2022
I participated in UCPC 2022 online preliminary, competitive programming contest in Korea. [Problems (in Korean)](https://www.acmicpc.net/category/detail/3138)

Problem H was the most interesting, basically an advanced version of the well known "balanced parenthesis problem". Algorithmic arguments using stack and clever combinatorial arguments about Catalan numbers was crucial.


### July 04, 2022
In preparation for UCPC 2022 final round, I participated in Codeforces Round 804 (Div 2). 


### July 06, 2022
I spent some time cleaning up my old codes and implementations of several algorithms.

`Prob` : I started studying some probability theory, in attempt to understand some concepts frequently arising from randomized algorithms such as martingales and Markov chains. Since I don't really need things to be in extensive depth, I chose "A First look at rigorous probability theory" by J.S.Rosenthal. 

### July 09, 2022
In preparation for UCPC 2022 final round, our team solved ACM-ICPC Seoul Regional 2021. Our performance was not the best, and I suffered from implementing weird inclusion-exclusion stuff. Maybe I will write about this team practice session on my blog?
