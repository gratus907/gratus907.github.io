ISAAC (International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation) was held in Hanyang Univ, Seoul, Korea. I had an oppertunity to attend the conference in person, together with my labmates. 

This was my first time attending an international academic conference, and it had been great time for learning new topics and taking a glance at what is being studied as the cutting-edge research. 

While most of the presentations were immensely interesting, I will try to summarize few of them which I learned the most :) 

**Day 1 : Invited Talk, Succint data structures, Graph algorithms**

**Day 2 : Invited Talk, Graph algorithms, Combinatorics**

**Day 3 : Best paper, Graph algorithms**
