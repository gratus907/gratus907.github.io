  abstract  = {Recent contrastive learning methods have shown to be effective in various tasks, learning generalizable representations invariant to data augmentation thereby leading to state of the art performances. Regarding the multifaceted nature of large unlabeled data used in self-supervised learning while majority of real-word downstream tasks use single format of data, a multimodal framework that can train single modality to learn diverse perspectives from other modalities is an important challenge. In this paper, we propose TriCL (Triangular Contrastive Learning), a universal framework for trimodal contrastive learning. TriCL takes advantage of Triangular Area Loss, a novel intermodal contrastive loss that learns the angular geometry of the embedding space through simultaneously contrasting the area of positive and negative triplets. Systematic observation on embedding space in terms of alignment and uniformity showed that Triangular Area Loss can address the line-collapsing problem by discriminating modalities by angle. Our experimental results also demonstrate the outperformance of TriCL on downstream task of molecular property prediction which implies that the advantages of the embedding space indeed benefits the performance on downstream tasks.},

  abstract  = {Subgraph counting is a fundamental problem in understanding and analyzing graph structured data, yet computationally challenging. This calls for an accurate and efficient algorithm for Subgraph Cardinality Estimation, which is to estimate the number of all isomorphic embeddings of a query graph in a data graph. We present FaSTest, a novel algorithm that combines (1) a powerful filtering technique to significantly reduce the sample space, (2) an adaptive tree sampling algorithm for accurate and efficient estimation, and (3) a worst-case optimal stratified graph sampling algorithm for difficult instances. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that FaSTest outperforms state-of-the-art sampling-based methods by up to two orders of magnitude and GNN-based methods by up to three orders of magnitude in terms of accuracy.},
